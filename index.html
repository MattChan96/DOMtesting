				<strong>The fellowship of the ring</strong>
				In the Second Age of Middle-earth, the lords of Elves, Dwarves, and Men
				are given Rings of Power. Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron
				forges the One Ring in Mount Doom, instilling into it a great part of
				his power, to dominate the other Rings so he might conquer Middle-earth.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>The Return of the King</strong>
				Awakening from a dream of Gandalf fighting the Balrog in Moria, Frodo
				Baggins finds himself, along with Samwise Gamgee, lost in the Emyn Muil
				near Mordor. They discover that they are being tracked by Gollum, a
				former bearer of the One Ring. Capturing Gollum, Frodo takes pity and
				allows him to guide them, reminding Sam that they will need Gollum's
				help to infiltrate Mordor.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>The Two Towers</strong>
				The hobbit Sméagol is fishing with his cousin Déagol, who discovers the
				One Ring in the river. Sméagol's mind is ensnared by the Ring, and he
				kills his cousin for it. Increasingly corrupted physically and mentally,
				he retreats into the Misty Mountains and becomes known as Gollum.
